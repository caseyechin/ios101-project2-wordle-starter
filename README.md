# Project 2 - *Wordle pt.2*

Submitted by: **Casey Chin**

**Wordle pt.2** is an app that generates random words for the user to guess, giving hints by color coding the letters. It can be set to different themes, and has an alien mode.

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- [ ] I changed some of the words because some of them weren't the right length and I changed the animal and countries categories into mario and pokemon because I thought they woule be more fun.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I got a bit confused by segues and how they worked, but I figured it out pretty quickly.
